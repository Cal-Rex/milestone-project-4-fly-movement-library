### Dan Cahill

> “The UI comes across as a bit flat. Also, things on the pages seem to be squashed up at the top and you have loads of room On the bottom half of the screen. Also, I think it takes too many clicks to get to a movement. If I know what im looking for I Shouldn’t have to tap to open a search bar, enter the item, then go to a eperate page to click on it again. I also think the icons Being green is a bit much?”

Came across no major issues during testing. But provided valuable feedback:

### Jonathan Walker

> Video embed working fine. Search bar has "search" in it, but very hard to see - prob could be removed (as search stated next to it)

Viewed on PC, could see that page was not fitting correctly. All other elements working normally

### Lily Elakha

> “No breakage at all even the thing I thought mighta been questionable” ... “casually squatting a 9trillion ton weight… just 1 rep… don’t want to over do it” ... “The moon is where I keep my medicine ball”

Found no major issues. Did highlight how that predictive search functions were isolated to the index view. Tested 1-rm field to
See what characters could be taken and numbers are only acceptable. However, it was indicated that a crazy amount of digits
could be put in

| "Great so far! The Deadlift thing is missing though. And after choosing a movement from the drop-down menu  and hitting search, I can’t seem to pick the dropdown list again unless I go back to dashboard." | "Wondering if maybe the icon here can be different as I didn’t think it meant «history», but to flag something" | "Otherwise, working really good! It’s a bit hard to see the «search» text. Haven’t been able to break it though" |
